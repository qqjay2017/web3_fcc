# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts
```

## 部署命令

```
yarn hardhat deploy --network goerli
```

```
yarn add @nomiclabs/hardhat-ethers@npm:hardhat-deploy-ethers
```
